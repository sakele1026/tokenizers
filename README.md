Provides an implementation of today's most used tokenizers, with a focus on performance and
versatility.

## Main features:

 - Train new vocabularies and tokenize, using todays most used tokenizers.
 - Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation. Takes
   less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server's CPU.
 - Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.
 - Designed for research and production.
 - Normalization comes with alignments tracking. It's always possible to get the part of the
   original sentence that corresponds to a given token.
 - Does all the pre-processing: Truncate, Pad, add the special tokens your model needs.
