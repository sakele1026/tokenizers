/**
 * A Tokenizer works as a pipeline, it processes some raw text as input and outputs
 * an `Encoding`.
 * The various steps of the pipeline are:
 * 1. The `Normalizer`: in charge of normalizing the text. Common examples of
 *    normalization are the unicode normalization standards, such as NFD or NFKC.
 * 2. The `PreTokenizer`: in charge of creating initial words splits in the text.
 *    The most common way of splitting text is simply on whitespace.
 * 3. The `Model`: in charge of doing the actual tokenization. An example of a
 *    `Model` would be `BPE` or `WordPiece`.
 * 4. The `PostProcessor`: in charge of post-processing the `Encoding` to add anything
 *    relevant that, for example, a language model would need, such as special tokens.
